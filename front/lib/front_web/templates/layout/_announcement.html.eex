<!--

A site wide announcement displays useful news to our customers. There can be
only one active site wide announcement, and each new announcement has a
unique ID.

Usage:

  1. Modify the content.
  2. Update the data-id . Incremental number update is :ok_hand:.

Implementation details:

When an announcement is closed, we store a cookie in the customers browser
with that ID.

Scenarios:

1. There is no cookie in the customers browser
   => We show the announcement

2. There is a cookie in the customer's browser, but the ID is different
   => This cookie was set when a customer closed a previous announcements.
   => We show the announcement.

3. There is a cookie in the customer's browser, and the ID is the same as
   the current announcement.
   => We hide the announcement.

The manager of the announcement can be found in:
